# Language Dropdown Test Guide

## How to Test the Language Dropdown

### 1. Desktop Testing

1. Visit `http://localhost:4322/de/` (German version)
2. Look for the language dropdown in the top navigation (ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª DE â–¼)
3. Click on the dropdown button
4. Verify that:
   - The dropdown opens with a smooth animation
   - Two options appear: ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Deutsch and ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ English
   - The arrow rotates when opened
   - Clicking outside the dropdown closes it
   - Clicking on "English" takes you to `/en/`
   - Clicking on "Deutsch" takes you to `/de/`

### 2. Mobile Testing

1. Resize your browser window to mobile size or use browser dev tools
2. The language dropdown should appear in the mobile menu
3. Click the hamburger menu (â˜°) to open mobile navigation
4. Find the language switcher in the mobile menu
5. Test the same functionality as desktop

### 3. URL Testing

- German home: `http://localhost:4322/de/` or `http://localhost:4322/`
- English home: `http://localhost:4322/en/`
- German workshop: `http://localhost:4322/de/workshop`
- English workshop: `http://localhost:4322/en/workshop`

### 4. Expected Behavior

- âœ… Dropdown opens when clicked
- âœ… Dropdown closes when clicking outside
- âœ… Language switching works correctly
- âœ… Current language is highlighted
- âœ… Arrow rotates when dropdown is open
- âœ… Smooth animations
- âœ… Mobile menu compatibility

## Troubleshooting

If the dropdown still doesn't work:

1. **Check Console Errors**: Open browser dev tools and look for JavaScript errors
2. **Clear Cache**: Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. **Check Network**: Ensure all JavaScript files are loading correctly
4. **Verify React Hydration**: The navbar should be a React component with `client:load`

## Fixed Issues

- âœ… Added missing `getPathWithoutLocale` import
- âœ… Added `useRef` and `useEffect` for proper dropdown handling
- âœ… Added `stopPropagation()` to prevent event conflicts
- âœ… Added click-outside detection to close dropdown
- âœ… Added safety checks for `window` object
- âœ… Added rotation animation for dropdown arrow
- âœ… Added smooth fade-in animation for dropdown
- âœ… Added proper z-index to prevent overlap issues
- âœ… Added mobile menu compatibility
