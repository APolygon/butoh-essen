      <h2>What is Butoh?</h2>
      <p>
        Butoh is a unique form of Japanese contemporary dance that emerged in the 1950s. 
        It combines elements of traditional Japanese dance, German expressionism, and 
        avant-garde performance art to create a deeply personal and transformative 
        movement experience.
