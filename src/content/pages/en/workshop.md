      All cells in our body consist of interconnected atoms. These connections are in constant transformation, changing, breaking apart and reconnecting, in an eternal dance enabled by space and energy. Human existence is also based on connections and exchange. To understand these connections, we need space and silence so that we can feel the dance of life.

      This workshop explores innovative ways to create personal movements, focusing on the spaces and silence between movements in our body. Guided explorations with concrete and abstract images help us discover new interactions with space and others. The silence between movements is the gateway to new possibilities.

      Every human being is a beautiful and unique form of life that is connected to everything. Let us discover our unique qualities and movements and share them as gifts with others to strengthen the bonds that connect us.

      Maruska Ronchi is a dancer and choreographer. After graduating in Contemporary Dance, she discovered Butoh in 2009 through Atsushi Takenouchi. She studied with him for 14 years and became his assistant at the Butoh school in Italy, where she could intensively practice, learn and teach.

      She learned from other important Butoh masters, including Yumiko Yoshioka, Yoshito Ohno, Minako Seki, Seisaku, Carlotta Ikeda, Ima Tenko, Natsu Nakajima, Semimaru (Sankai Yuku), Imre Tohrman and Masaki Iwana.

      Her research is an alchemical process that seeks physical and spiritual transformation in the matter of the body. She investigates not only movement, but also silence, emptiness, stillness and the space in between.

      She travels around the world and shares her dance and practices through performances, workshops and collaboration with international artists. She presents her works in many European countries, as well as in Canada, Mauritius and Japan.
