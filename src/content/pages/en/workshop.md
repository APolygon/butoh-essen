      All cells in our body consist of interconnected atoms. These connections are in constant transformation, changing, breaking apart and reconnecting in an eternal dance made possible through space and energy. Human existence, too, is based on connections and exchange. To understand these connections, we need space and silence so that we can feel the dance of life.

      This workshop explores innovative ways to create personal movements, focusing on the spaces and silence between movements in our body. Guided explorations with concrete and abstract images help us discover new interactions with space and others. The silence between movements is the gateway to new possibilities.

      Every human being is a beautiful and unique form of life connected to everything. Let's discover our unique qualities and movements and share them as gifts with others to strengthen the bonds that connect us.
