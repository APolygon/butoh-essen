      ### Liability for Content

      The contents of this website have been created with the utmost care and to the best of our knowledge. However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of the content provided. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages according to § 7 Para. 1 DDG (formerly § 7 Para. 1 TMG) and general laws. According to §§ 8 to 10 DDG, however, we are not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the time of knowledge of a specific legal violation. Upon becoming aware of such violations, we will remove this content immediately.

      ### Liability for Links

      Our website contains links to external third-party websites over whose content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the linked pages is always responsible for their content. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking; illegal content was not apparent at that time. However, permanent monitoring of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation of law. If we become aware of any legal violations, we will remove such links immediately.

      ### Copyright

      The content and works created by the site operators on these pages are subject to German copyright law. The reproduction, editing, distribution and any kind of exploitation outside the limits of copyright require the written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are only permitted for private, non-commercial use. Insofar as the content on this site was not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected and content is marked as such.

      This data is deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for processing the inquiry.

      ## 5. Data Transfer
