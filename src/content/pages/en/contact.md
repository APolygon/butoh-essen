      **Maruska Ronchi** is a dancer and choreographer. After graduating in Contemporary Dance, she discovered Butoh in 2009 through Atsushi Takenouchi. She studied with him for 14 years and became his assistant at the Butoh school in Italy, where she could intensively practice, learn and teach.

      She learned from other important Butoh masters, including Yumiko Yoshioka, Yoshito Ohno, Minako Seki, Seisaku, Carlotta Ikeda, Ima Tenko, Natsu Nakajima, Semimaru (Sankai Yuku), Imre Tohrman and Masaki Iwana.

      Her research is an alchemical process that seeks physical and spiritual transformation in the matter of the body. She investigates not only movement, but also silence, emptiness, stillness and the space in between.
